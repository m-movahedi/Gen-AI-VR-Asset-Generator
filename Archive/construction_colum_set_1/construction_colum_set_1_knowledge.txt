Condition Index (CI)	Condition Rating	Description
CI 85–100	Excellent (Green)	I-beam is in like-new condition. No visible corrosion, deformation, cracks, or coating failures. Load-bearing performance is unaffected. No maintenance required.
CI 70–84	Good (Green)	Minor surface corrosion or coating wear. No structural deformation. Beam maintains full capacity. Preventive maintenance recommended (e.g., surface cleaning, touch-up coating).
CI 55–69	Fair (Yellow)	Moderate corrosion (≤10% surface area), some protective coating loss. No structural compromise, but early signs of material thinning or scale buildup. Needs minor repair and recoating.
CI 40–54	Poor (Orange)	Extensive corrosion (10–30%), coating failure, possible minor pitting. Signs of early structural degradation (e.g., web thinning, flange scaling). Load capacity not yet impacted, but deterioration progressing. Requires corrective maintenance.
CI 0–39	Failed/Critical (Red)	Severe corrosion (>30%), flaking, pitting, or deformation. Cracks, delamination, or cross-section loss may exist. Structural capacity may be reduced. Immediate repair, reinforcement, or replacement needed. Safety risk present.
